# React Card Deck App

A simple ReactJS application that simulates a deck of playing cards. The app allows users to:

- Draw cards from a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal 5 or 7 cards.
- Reset the deck, toss a selected card, regroup (shuffle) the hand, and add a wildcard.

The application is built using embedded React/JS in a single HTML file and external CSS for styling, with custom button designs and responsive layout using Bootstrap.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to run the application.
